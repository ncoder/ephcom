.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Reads two binary ephemeris files and compares their double precision values
in the header constants and in data blocks that follow the header.
Should only be used to compare ephemeris files generated by the utilities
in the ephcom package with binary ephemeris files from JPL.
.TP
\fIephemeris1\fR
the first binary ephemeris input file.
.TP
\fIephemeris2\fR
the second binary ephemeris input file.
.TP
\fIoutput-file\fR
optional output file.  If omitted or if \fIoutput-file\fR is "-",
