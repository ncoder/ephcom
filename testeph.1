.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Reads test dates and coordinate values from a JPL TESTPO file,
interpolates coordinates from a binary ephemeris file for those dates,
and compares with precomputed results given in the JPL TESTPO file.
Reports results for any dates that are in the range of the binary
ephemeris file.  Silently skips dates in the TESTPO file not the in range
of the binary ephemeris file.
.TP
\fIephemeris-file\fR
the binary ephemeris input file.
.TP
\fItestpo-file\fR
JPL TESTPO.x file, where 'x' is the ephemeris number (e.g., 200, 405, and 406).
If "-", the file will be read from stdin.
.TP
\fIoutput-file\fR
optional output file for results.  If omitted or if \fIoutput-file\fR
is "-", output is written to stdout.
