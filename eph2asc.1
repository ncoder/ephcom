.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Converts a binary ephemeris file into an ASCII header file and an ASCII
data block file.
.TP
\fIephemeris\fR
binary ephemeris input file.
.TP
\fIheader-file\fR
ASCII header file.
.TP
\fIdata-file\fR
ASCII data blocks, printed three double precision coefficients per line.
.TP
\fIstartJD\fR
optional Julian Day at which to begin (note that eph2asc
must begin at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably start soon before the desired \fIstartJD\fR).
If not specified, all of both input files are read.
.TP
\fIstopJD\fR
optional Julian Day at which to stop (note that eph2asc
must end at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably end soon after the desired \fIstopJD\fR).
If not specified, both input files are read to the end.
