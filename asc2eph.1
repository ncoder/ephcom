.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Converts an ASCII header and ASCII data block file to a binary ephemeris file.
.TP
\fIheader-file\fR
ASCII header file.  If "-", the file will be read from stdin.
.TP
\fIdata-file\fR
ASCII data blocks, printed three double precision coefficients per line.
If "-", the file will be read from stdin and is expected to follow the
ASCII header.  This allows syntax on Unix such as
.TP
     cat HEADER.405 ascp2000.405 | asc2eph - - eph2000.405
.TP
\fIephemeris\fR
binary ephemeris output file.  This cannot be written to stdout, because
the final header cannot be formed until all data blocks are read.
.TP
\fIstartJD\fR
optional Julian Day at which to begin (note that asc2eph
must begin at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably start soon before the desired \fIstartJD\fR).
If not specified, all of both input files are read.
.TP
\fIstopJD\fR
optional Julian Day at which to stop (note that asc2eph
must end at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably end soon after the desired \fIstopJD\fR).
If not specified, both input files are read to the end.
