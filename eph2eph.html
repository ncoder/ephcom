<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<P>

Merges two JPL binary ephemeris files into a third binary ephemeris file.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>input1</I><DD>
first binary ephemeris input file.
<DT><I>input2</I><DD>
second binary ephemeris input file.
If <I>input1</I> is the same as <I>input2</I>,
<B>eph2eph</B>

will &quot;scrub&quot; the input ephemeris file to remove any inconsistencies.  (See
the intentional side effects mentioned below.)
<DT><I>output</I><DD>
the merged binary ephemeris file.
<DT><I>startJD</I><DD>
optional Julian Day at which to begin (note that eph2eph
must begin at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably start soon before the desired <I>startJD</I>).
If not specified, all of both input files are read.
<DT><I>stopJD</I><DD>
optional Julian Day at which to stop (note that eph2eph
must end at an integral ephemeris data block boundary of
typically 32 or 64 days, so
it will probably end soon after the desired <I>stopJD</I>).
If not specified, both input files are read to the end.
</DL>
<P>

<B>eph2eph</B>

reads in two JPL binary ephemeris files and merges them into
a third binary ephemeris file.  The first two files must have the same
JPL ephemeris number, Earth-Moon Mass Ratio (EMRAT), distance of an AU
(in kilometers), number of constants in the header, and number of
coefficients in a data block.  Otherwise, they were not generated from
the same ephemeris and are not compatible.
<P>

The two input files must be adjacent in time, with either one ending
exactly where the other begins, or with some overlap between the end
of the first file and the beginning of the second.  Otherwise, there
would be a gap with unknown coefficients for a date span.
<P>

As an intentional side effect,
<B>eph2eph</B>

will remove several formatting errors in the original JPL files:
the last data block (a copy of the second to last block) is not repeated;
ASCII start and stop dates in the header are corrected;
ipt[*][0] and lpt[0] contain the next possible coefficient location
rather than 0 (this is the preferred format, as communicated by
JPL's Myles Standish to Paul Hardy); data in unused portions of the
header is set to all zeroes.
